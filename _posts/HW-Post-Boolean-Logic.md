# Boolean Notes
## Boolean Basics

Booleans are statements that are either true or false
- They are used to run certain part of code if the statements are true, and other parts of code if false
  - EX: if subtotal is `x > $50` and we do something with that depending on if the statement is true or false
  
  Some comparison operators
   - `>`
   - `>=`
   - `<`
   - `<=`
   - `==`
   - `!=`
   - `===`
   
   ## Bolean Operators
     - AND uses `&`
     - OR uses `|`
     - NOT uses `!`
     - XOR uses `^`
     - short-circuit OR uses `||`
     - short-circuit AND uses `&&`
     - equal to uses `==`
     - NOT equal to uses `!=`
