What is life without coffee?

And more importantly, where does it come from?


These days, the most popular and convenient way to enjoy coffee is via K-Cups.

K-Cups are made up of a plastic cup with a filter and ground coffee, sealed airtight. The K-Cups are then placed in the Keurig machine where they are pierced on the top and bottom. Hot pressurized water then enters the cup from the top and hot coffee is made.
