# GRASP Principles

### GRASP Stands For 

#### **General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns**

The GRASP Principles are the guidelines for assigning responsibility to classes and objects in object oriented design. 

GRASP consists of 9 patterns that can be used to solve commonly experienced problems in programming. 





|        CREATOR       | Decides with class is responsible for creating a new instance of a class.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|:--------------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| INFORMATION EXPERT   | Assigning the responsibility of creating an object to the "expert". This means the object  creating an instance of another has all of the information needed to create that object.                                                                                                      |
| LOW COUPLING         | Minimizing dependency between objects. This helps keep code easy to manage and reuse-able if needed. A good example from our TAG program is the Command Class. The  command class allows us to add additional classes that behave the same way, without having to  change too much code. |
| HIGH COHESION        | High Cohesion means creating many classes that handle few responsibilities. The classes should have very few methods and should work with other classes to fulfill a collective goal.                                                                                                    |
| CONTROLLER           | The controller works like an interface between the UI and the domain objects. The controller   will receive input from UI and then delegates the requests to other objects.                                                                                                              |
| INDIRECTION          | assigns the responsibility of communicating between two elements to an intermediate unit to  minimize dependency                                                                                                                                                                         |
| POLYMORPHISM         | the responsibility of how to handle related but varying elements based on element type. Using polymorphic operations over separating based on type                                                                                                                                       |
| PROTECTED VARIATIONS | Protects how your objects can change, similar to the concept of imutability ex: putting a setter in a protected interface                                                                                                                                                                |
| PURE FABRICATION     | Fabricating an object for a functionality found in your class that makes it seem as  though that class is doing too many things. When a part of your code is identified as  possibly adding more responsibilities to a class, it should be extracted and made into a separate object.    |
